### About Us
Octabot is a software startup company that will shine very soon in the market. Our first project is called Wordspace.
###### Background and Motivation
Bloggers generally depend on platforms that they have to work on publicizing their blogs via means of social media and SEO, this results in a lot of effort put into publicizing themselves and into marketing instead of actually focusing on work of their content. Basically what we are trying to build here is YouTube for Articles (written content).

You might argue why build such a tool similar to Tumblr, Wordpress, Medium or the like?

The main objective of such a service is to provide writers and independent journalist with a platform similar to that of YouTube which helps him understand their viewership as well as providing means of monetization whether that be sponsored ads or general ads.

Also with tools to allow for teamwork on such an “Online Newspaper” or “Blog”

###### Brief Description
As discussed above what we are trying to build here is basically YouTube for articles/blogs.

###### Expected functionality
+ Writing articles

+ Promoting content
+ Subscribing as a user to specific blogs/writers/streams/interests/etc..
+ Ad/Sponsor platform
+ Viewership Analytics
+ SM & SEO friendly
